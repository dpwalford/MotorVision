# About MOTORVISION
MOTORVISION is a adaptation of AlexNet that sorts Semi-trucks and Cars. Below are a few points of importance.
## Why an AlexNet to Sort Cars and Semitrucks is Important

- **Improved accuracy:** AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network that achieves high accuracy in image recognition tasks. Using AlexNet to sort cars and semitrucks can improve accuracy compared to other methods.

- **Efficient processing:** AlexNet is designed to process large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for sorting through large numbers of car and semitruck images. This could be particularly useful in industries like logistics or transportation, where quickly identifying and sorting vehicles is important.

- **Object detection:** AlexNet can not only classify images but also detect objects within them. This could be helpful for identifying specific features of cars and semitrucks, such as the shape of the vehicle or the type of trailer attached to a semitruck.

- **Automated sorting:** Using AlexNet to sort cars and semitrucks can automate the sorting process, reducing the need for human intervention. This could save time and money, as well as improve efficiency and accuracy.

- **Potential for scalability:** AlexNet's ability to handle large datasets and complex image recognition tasks makes it a promising candidate for scaling up to other types of vehicles or even other industries beyond transportation.
